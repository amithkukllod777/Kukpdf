# KukPDF — Feature Inventory

Roles: KukPDF is single-role (one end user). No admin/role hierarchy in the app. Auth uses the shared **Kuklabs Account**; cloud data is scoped server-side to the user's `openId`.

Legend — Implementation: ✅ Working · ⚠️ Partial · 🚧 Not built (honest message) · Test: SMOKE (opened, no crash — this audit) / NONE (no automated test). Docs: TODO.md + CLAUDE.md.
